# Simple Java Chat Application

This project is a simple online chat application developed in Java. The application allows multiple users to connect to a central server, send messages, and receive messages from other users.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- A command-line interface (CLI) like Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, or Terminal on macOS/Linux

## Directory Structure

ProgrammingAssignment_7/
├── src/
│ ├── ChatServer.java
│ └── ChatClient.java
└── README.md

## How to Run

### 1. Start the Server

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `src` directory where `ChatServer.java` is located.
  example: cd "C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\UoPeople\12. CS 1103-01 Programming 2 - AY2024-T4\Week 7\Programming Assignment 7\ProgrammingAssignment_7\src"

Compile the ChatServer.java file.
javac ChatServer.java

Run the ChatServer class.
java ChatServer

You should see the message "Chat server started..." indicating that the server is running.

2. Start the Client
Open another terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the src directory where ChatClient.java is located.
example: cd "C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\UoPeople\12. CS 1103-01 Programming 2 - AY2024-T4\Week 7\Programming Assignment 7\ProgrammingAssignment_7\src"

Compile the ChatClient.java file.
javac ChatClient.java

Run the ChatClient class.
java ChatClient
When prompted, type your message and press Enter to send it. You should see messages from other users if they are also connected to the server.

Example Usage
Start the server first.
Then start multiple clients.
Type messages in any client window and see them broadcasted to all other connected clients.

Error Handling
Ensure no other application is using the port 12345.
If you encounter java.net.BindException: Address already in use: bind, make sure to terminate any other instances of the server running on the same port.

Notes
Make sure the port number (12345) in ChatServer.java and ChatClient.java is within the valid range (0-65535) and is the same in both files.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the commands and use the specified port on your machine.
